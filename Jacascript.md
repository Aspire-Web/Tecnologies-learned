## General

in Javascript (or EcmaScript or Vanilla) you are able to maipulate the DOM of an html file by adding ne attributes to it. So it means it is quite necessary to understand html an css to start with Javascript.

## Common ways to start learning Javascript

> all is just ready, it needs only to be done

As every programming language it just needs a lot of __practise__ to get better. The one thing you should know before starting is:
- what is a variable

IT really helps to have some basic programming knowlege, too like:
- if else and loops
- functions
- logic Operators like in boolean algebra
- concepts of browser rendering

## JavaScript Syntax

 1. All lines should end with a ; *perhaps* some don't need it, but you can never be sure
 2. it works quite easy: select something and than tell what so do e.g. `document.getElementById("header").style.font-weight="bold"`
 3. work with the console to have feedback what went wrong.

## Other Technologies

- [git](git.md)
- [html](html.md)
- [css](css.md)
